To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, 
you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The 
calculator should have a display screen to show user input and 
results. Utilize CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event 
listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user 
input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill 
but can be done with basic knowledge of theseÂ technologies..
